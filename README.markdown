lLyrics
===============

lLyrics is a plugin for [Rhythmbox](http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/), which displays lyrics for the current playing song in the right sidebar.

Rhythmbox ships with a lyrics plugin, that is more or less broken and doesn't integrate well into the UI, so I decided to write a new one.
