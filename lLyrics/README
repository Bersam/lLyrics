lLyrics
===================

lLyrics is a Rhythmbox plug-in, which displays lyrics for the current playing song in the right sidebar.


I know there are already plugins, which are supposed to provide lyrics functionality for Rhythmbox, but they all don't work for me, so I decided to write my own.


You will always find the latest version at https://github.com/dmo60/lLyrics.

Credits
===================

I was highly inspired from the awesome Songbird plugin "MLyrics" (https://github.com/FreeleX/MLyrics).
I also took a few lines from the existing plugin ContextPane.
