lLyrics
===================

lLyrics is a Rhythmbox plug-in, which displays lyrics for the current playing song in the right sidebar.

I know there are already plugins, which are supposed to provide lyrics functionality for Rhythmbox, but they all don't work for me, so I decided to write my own.

More lyric sources will be added in the future. 

This project is hosted at github: https://github.com/dmo60/lLyrics

INSTALL
===================

Installing this plug-in is easy.

	1) Create the directory '~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lLyrics':
		mkdir ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
		
	2) Copy all files to the newly created directory (or extract this archive's contents into that directory):
		cp * ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
	
	3) Launch Rhythmbox and enable the lLyrics plugin under "Edit > Plugins".
	
Done.



Credits
===================

I was highly inspired from the awesome Songbird plugin "MLyrics" (https://github.com/FreeleX/MLyrics).
I also took a few lines from the existing plugin ContextPane.
