The goal of this project is to write a Rhythmbox plug-in, which displays lyrics for the current playing song in the right sidebar.

INSTALL
------------------
Installing this plug-in is easy.
Create the directory '~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lLyrics' :
	mkdir ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
Copy all files the newly created directory (or extract this archive's contents into that directory):
	cp * ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
Launch Rhythmbox and enable the plugin under "Edit > Plugins".
Done.
