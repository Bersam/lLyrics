lLyrics
===================

lLyrics is a Rhythmbox plug-in, which displays lyrics for the current playing song in the right sidebar.


I know there are already plugins, which are supposed to provide lyrics functionality for Rhythmbox, but they all don't work for me, so I decided to write my own.


Currently lyrics are stored at ~/.cache/rhythmbox/lyrics, so they don't have to be reloaded everytime. If you want to delete lyrics in order to rescan sources, search for the corresponding file and remove it. I am working on a more elegant solution for this.  

More lyric sources will be added in the future. I also plan to provide more functionality like manually reload lyrics from a specified source or writing lyrics to ID3-Tags. 

You will always find the latest version at https://github.com/dmo60/lLyrics. Stay tuned!

Credits
===================

I was highly inspired from the awesome Songbird plugin "MLyrics" (https://github.com/FreeleX/MLyrics).
I also took a few lines from the existing plugin ContextPane.
