lLyrics
===================

lLyrics is a Rhythmbox plug-in, which displays lyrics for the current playing song in the right sidebar.


I know there are already plugins, which are supposed to provide lyrics functionality for Rhythmbox, but they all don't work for me, so I decided to write my own.


Currently lyrics are stored at ~/.cache/rhythmbox/lyrics, so they don't have to be reloaded everytime. If you want to delete lyrics in order to rescan sources, search for the corresponding file and remove it. I am working on a more elegant solution for this.  

More lyric sources will be added in the future. I also plan to provide more functionality like manually reload lyrics from a specified source or writing lyrics to ID3-Tags. 

You will always find the latest version at https://github.com/dmo60/lLyrics. Stay tuned!

INSTALL
===================

Installing this plug-in is easy.

	1) Create the directory '~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lLyrics':
		mkdir ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
		
	2) Copy all files to the newly created directory (or extract this archive's contents into that directory):
		cp * ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lastfmplaycount
	
	3) Launch Rhythmbox and enable the lLyrics plugin under "Edit > Plugins".
	
Done.



Credits
===================

I was highly inspired from the awesome Songbird plugin "MLyrics" (https://github.com/FreeleX/MLyrics).
I also took a few lines from the existing plugin ContextPane.
